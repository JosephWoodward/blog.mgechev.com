JavaScript is the most popular language. Unfortunately, it is not well known yet. I have experience and prepared slides for few topics, which I can cover:

*   Introduction to JavaScript &#8211; it&#8217;s and introduction to JavaScript for advanced developers. Slides concentrate on unusual concepts of the language, like functional lexical scope, context, OO model.
*   jQuery and jQuery Mobile &#8211; this presentation covers jQuery&#8217;s API in depth and gives introduction to jQuery Mobile
*   Introduction to AngularJS &#8211; explains the base concepts of AngularJS &#8211; directives, controllers, filters, services, routing and animations.
*   AngularJS in depth &#8211; This presentation contains about 200 slides and covers AngularJS 1.1.5 and ~1.2.0 in depth.
*   Tools and best practices &#8211; Includes information of how you can profile your application, what tools you can use to automate your development process (Grunt, Yeoman) and even more&#8230;
